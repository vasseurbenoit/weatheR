	abstract = {Heat units, expressed in growing degree-days (GDD), are frequently used to describe the timing of biological processes. The basic equation used is GDD = [(TMAX + TMIN)2]−TBASE, where TMAX and TMIN are daily maximum and minimum air temperature, respectively, and TBASE is the base temperature. Two methods of interpreting this equation for calculating GDD are: (1) if the daily mean temperature is less than the base, it is set equal to the base temperature, or (2) if TMAX or TMIN {\textless} TBASE they are reset equal to TBASE. The objective of this paper is to show the differences which can result from using these two methods to estimate GDD, and make researchers and practitioners aware of the need to report clearly which method was used in the calculations. Although percent difference between methods of calculation are dependent on TMAX and TMIN data used to compute GDD, our comparisons have produced differences up to 83\% when using a 0°C base for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Greater differences were found for corn (Zea mays L.) when using a base temperature of 10°C. Differences between the methods occur if only TMIN is less than TBASE, and then Method 1 accumulates fewer GDD than Method 2. When incorporating an upper threshold, as commonly done with corn, there was a greater difference between the two methods. Not recognizing the discrepancy between methods can result in confusion and add error in quantifying relationships between heat unit accumulation and timing of events in crop development and growth, particularly in crop simulation models. This paper demonstrates the need for authors to clearly communicate the method of calculating GDD so others can correctly interpret and apply reported results.},

	abstract = {Growing degree days (GDD) is a tool to predict plant growth and can be adapted for use in any plant species, including cover crops. A limitation of the GDD calculation is accurate temperature parameters used to predict plant development. For most cover crop species, the cardinal temperatures are not well defined in the literature, leading to a less accurate calculation of GDD. The objective of this study was to determine the cardinal temperatures of eight cover crop species, including Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum), balansa clover (Trifolium michelianum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), black-seeded oats (Avena sativa), common vetch (Vicia sativa), cereal rye (Secale cereale), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), using a growth chamber experiment. Seven different temperature regimes from 4 to 34°C were implemented, and the number of leaves was counted from day 0 to 21. As a result, the data were regressed to estimate the cardinal temperatures for each species. The results of this research identified base (2), optimum (3), and maximum (8) temperatures for cover crops that were not previously reported. Five cardinal temperatures determined in this study were different from what was previously recorded; base and optimum temperatures were −4.5 and 24.8°C for cereal rye, 3.9 and 26.6°C for crimson clover, and the base temperature was 3.4°C for balansa clover. The successful identification of these cardinal temperatures for cover crops will allow the development of plant growth and biomass prediction models to aid in cover crop termination decision support tools.},

	abstract = {The Beta function, commonly used as a skewed probability density function in statistics, was introduced to describe the effect of temperature on the rate of crop development. The framework is set by three cardinal temperatures, namely the base (Tb), the optimum (To) and the ceiling (Tc) temperature. The model parameters Tb and Tc and three other coefficients μ, α and β can be used to derive the value of To and the maximum development rate. Parameter α also characterizes the curvature of the relationship with temperatures between Tb and To, and parameter β describes the curvature between To and Tc. The model has one parameter less than the Rice Clock Model (RCM); and in contrast to the RCM, it ensures that the maximum development rate occurs exactly at To. The model accurately described the response to temperature of several developmental processes, and was superior to two widely used thermal time approaches in predicting rice flowering time.},
