The goal of weatheR is to provide functions that help analyzing and visualizing
weather and climatic data.

- `c` functions are for climate.
- `e` functions are for ETP.
- `r` functions are for radiation.
- `t` functions are for temperature.
- `z` functions are tools.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vasseurbenoit/weatheR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, fig.cap="Ombrothermic diagram of Lexington Blue Grass Airport.", warning=FALSE}
# Library
library(weatheR)

# Climate
c_ombrothermic_diagram(data = weather_blue_grass_airport,
                       year_start = 1991,
                       year_end = 2020,
                       source = "Blue Grass Airport (Lexington)")

# ETP
e_evapotranspiration_fao56(altitude = 30,
                           R_inc = 5,
                           T_air_moy = 20,
                           T_air_min = 10,
                           T_air_max = 30)

# Radiation
r_radiation_inc_fao56(longitude = 10,
                      latitude = 35,
                      altitude = 30,
                      date = "2022-11-04",
                      T_air_min = 5,
                      T_air_max = 15)

# Temperature
t_growing_degree_days(T_air_avg = 15,
                      T_base = 5,
                      T_opt = 10,
                      T_max = 20,
                      method = "C")
```
